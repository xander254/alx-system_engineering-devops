How I moved the files from my device to the remote server using SFTP
1. I connected to the server remotely by entering sftp[user@]host
    i.e sftp 95{redacted}b@{redacted}4a7b.b8.alx-cod.online
2. I entered the password of the server
3. once in, I used the cd command to navigate to "/root/alx-system_eng   ineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/"
4. I then used !ls to view the contents of my local directory
5. I proceded to use "put filename" to push the files to the remote        server
6. Checked their existance by using ls
7. Task complete I closed the connection using exit command
